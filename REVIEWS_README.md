```

## How It Works

### 1. Loading Reviews
- On page load, the system tries to load reviews from localStorage first
- If no local reviews exist, it loads from `data/reviews.json`
- Reviews are sorted by date (newest first) and limited to 6 displayed

### 2. Displaying Reviews
- Each review shows: name, date, star rating, comment, and verification status
- Verified stays show a special badge
- Reviews are displayed in a single-row carousel that auto-rotates every 8 seconds
- Users can manually navigate using arrow buttons or clickable dots
- Carousel pauses on hover and resumes when mouse leaves

### 3. Submitting Reviews
- Form includes: name, email, rating, and comment fields
- Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- Email is stored but never displayed publicly
- New reviews are added to localStorage and appear immediately

### 4. Data Storage
- **Current**: Uses localStorage for browser persistence
- **Future**: Can be upgraded to use PHP backend with database storage

## Review Data Structure

Each review contains:
```json
{
    "id": "unique_identifier",
    "name": "Guest Name",
    "email": "guest@example.com",
    "rating": 5,
    "comment": "Review text here...",
    "date": "2025-08-15",
    "verified": true
}
```

## Usage

### For Guests
1. **Reading Reviews**: Scroll to the "What Our Guests Say" section on the home page to view the rotating carousel of reviews from previous guests. Use the arrow buttons or dots to navigate manually, or wait for automatic rotation.
2. **Submitting Reviews**: 
   - Go to the About page and scroll to the "Share Your Experience" section at the bottom
   - Fill out the review form with your name, email, rating, and comments
   - Submit your review and it will appear on the home page
3. **Quick Access**: Click the "Share Your Experience" button in the reviews section on the home page to go directly to the review form

### For Admin
#### **Review Verification & Management**
1. **Access Admin Panel**: Navigate to `admin-reviews.html`
2. **View Statistics**: See total reviews, verified count, and average ratings
3. **Verify Reviews**: Click ✓ button next to legitimate guest reviews
4. **Filter Reviews**: View all, verified only, unverified only, or recent reviews
5. **Edit Reviews**: Modify names, ratings, or comments as needed
6. **Delete Reviews**: Remove inappropriate or fake reviews

#### **Cleanup Tools**
- Use `cleanup-reviews.html` to remove test reviews automatically
- Reviews are stored in localStorage and can be managed via admin tools
- For production use, consider implementing the PHP backend

## Customization

### Adding More Sample Reviews
Edit `data/reviews.json` and add new review objects following the existing structure.

### Changing Display Settings
In `script.js`, modify:
- `displayReviews.slice(0, 6)` - Change number of reviews displayed
- Form validation rules in `validateField()` method
- Styling in `css/style.css` under the "Reviews Section" comment

## Future Upgrades

### Server-Side Processing
The included `api/submit-review.php` provides:
- Server-side validation
- Email notifications to admin
- Better data persistence
- Spam protection capabilities

### Database Integration
Could be upgraded to use:
- MySQL/PostgreSQL database
- Admin panel for review management
- Advanced features like reply to reviews
- Review moderation system

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (all modern versions)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- ⚠️ Internet Explorer not supported (uses modern JavaScript)

## Security Considerations
- Input is sanitized using `escapeHtml()` function
- Email addresses are never displayed publicly
- Form validation prevents malicious input
- For production, implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA

## Performance
- Lightweight and fast loading
- No external dependencies
- Minimal impact on page load time
- Efficient localStorage usage

## Maintenance
- Regularly backup reviews from localStorage if using client-side only
- Monitor review quality and moderate as needed
- Consider implementing the PHP backend for production use
- Update sample reviews with real guest feedback
